# Lithograph

Lithograph is a service that adds screenshots to your bookmark posts.

When you sign in, you tell Lithograph where it can find your bookmark posts. Lithograph subscribed to the feed, and updates the posts (or sends photo comments via Webmention) with screenshots of the URLs you bookmarked.

## Todo

Lithograph is a work in progress. Currently only the bare minimum functionality is implemented. The interface for actually setting it up needs to be written still.
